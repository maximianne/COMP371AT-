# COMP371AT-
Assessment test for comp371- interview question 

Classes: 
ROBOTDeliver.java
A class where the robot who delivers is defined, they have the ability to recieve orders from the ROBOTOrders and deliver these orders to the chef. 
The plates are delivered in the order that orders are placed  

CUSTOMER.java 
A class where a customer is defined, the ability to order, get check and pay is defined as well. 
In this restaurant it is assumed that the customers do not cancel orders and will call on the robot to get a check, get plates etc… 
I am assuming every person comes alone, however, if I had more time I would make it so multiple customers come to the same party, add a split check method 
 
RESTURANT.java
A class where a resturant is defined. 

ROBOTOrders.java 
A class where the robot who takes orders and keeps track of a tab is defined. 
Eventually: add a list that keeps track of when a plate is delivered and picked up and then deletes it 
Add so that the person can only leave once they’ve gotten their order and their plate as been delivered

CHEF/java 
A class where a chef is defined. They recieve the orders and give plates to robot deliver to get them to the customer
